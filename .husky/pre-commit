# Run lint-staged for staged files (linting and formatting)
pnpm lint-staged

# Run type checking on all files (since TypeScript needs full project context)
pnpm type-check

# Consider moving build check to pre-push hook for better developer experience
# Uncomment the next line if you want to ensure build passes before every commit:
