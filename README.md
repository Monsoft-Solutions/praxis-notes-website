## SEO and Sitemap

This project uses Next.js App Router's built-in sitemap generation. The sitemap is automatically generated during the build process.

### Sitemap Generation

The sitemap is defined in `app/sitemap.ts` and uses the App Router's [Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap). It dynamically generates URLs for:

- Static pages (home, about, features, etc.)
- Dynamic pages (resources with slugs)

This approach eliminates the need for a separate sitemap generation package like `next-sitemap`.

### Robots.txt Generation

Similarly, robots.txt is generated using the App Router's built-in functionality in `app/robots.ts`.

### Sitemap Deployment

When you build the project with `pnpm build`, the sitemap is automatically:

1. Generated by Next.js at build time from `app/sitemap.ts`
2. Copied to the `public` directory as `sitemap_static.xml` for easy access

This strategy avoids conflicts between the dynamic sitemap that Next.js serves and the static copy used for search engine discovery.

### Notifying Search Engines

After building, you can notify Google about your sitemap with:

```bash
pnpm sitemap:notify
```

This will read the generated sitemap and send updates to Google Search Console.

#### Google Search Console Setup

To use the notification feature, you need to set up Google Search Console:

1. Verify ownership of your domain in Google Search Console
2. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Indexing API
3. Create service account credentials
4. Set the following environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - The service account email
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` - The private key for the service account

For local testing, these can be added to your `.env` file.
